  * New translation: Spanish

                                 -~=o=~-
  
  ==[ Version 0.90 beta ]==
     --{ 2009-08-16 }--
  * New composition method: Diagonal Rule
  * User customizable line thickness
  * New translation: German
  * Faster layers creation
  * Lines are more visible on a dark background (white stroke added)

                                 -~=o=~-

  ==[ Version 0.85 beta ]==
     --{ 2009-08-06 }--
  * It is now CS2 compatible!
  * Golden spirals added
  * "Choose guidelines" dialog added. Now you can choose which guidelines
    would be drawn. Last choice is remembered.
  * Ability to continue interrupted crop added. The script finds the 'Golden
    Crop by SzopeN'  group and resumes crop in interactive mode
	To force adding new 'Golden Crop by SzopeN' group, select the bottommost
	layer (for example: Background)
  * The script behaves like a plugin, now resides in File>Automate>Golden Crop
  * It can be recorded in action (though it is still user-interactive,
    only guidelines choice is saved)
  + [Alt],[key] problem fixed in dialog boxes
  + Minor fix in rotation, detecting portrait/landscape crop
  ~ Code cleanup and optimization
